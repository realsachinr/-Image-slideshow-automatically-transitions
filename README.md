I made an image slideshow using HTML and CSS. This slideshow automatically switches between different images without needing any manual control. It's like a continuous display of pictures, where each picture fades into the next smoothly. I used HTML to structure the slideshow and CSS to style it, making it look nice and appealing. It's a cool way to showcase multiple images without users having to do anything - they can just sit back and enjoy the show!
